# Aircraft Altitude Estimation using Kalman Filter

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Kalman filter for estimating the altitude of an aircraft based on sensor measurements. The Kalman filter is applied to a dataset containing accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, height, and vertical speed measurements.

## Kalman Filter Algorithm

The Kalman filter algorithm implemented in this code follows these key steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the state variables, covariance matrices, and other parameters required for the Kalman filter.

2. **Prediction**: Predict the next state of the system based on the previous state and system dynamics using the state transition matrix.

3. **Measurement Update**: Update the state estimate based on the measurement obtained from the sensor, taking into account the measurement noise and uncertainty.

4. **Iterative Process**: Iterate the prediction and measurement update steps over time to continuously refine the altitude estimate as new sensor measurements become available.
